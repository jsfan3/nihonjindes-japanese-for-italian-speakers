# nihonjindes-japanese-for-italian-speakers
A Japanese-learning tool designed for Italian speakers. It's a work in progress, based on a fork of [LibreLingo Community](https://github.com/LibreLingoCommunity/LibreLingo).

This course is based on my personal learning journey. I share and update it as I go along, in case it is useful to other students.

I am the author of all the images.
